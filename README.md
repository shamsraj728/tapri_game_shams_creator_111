## 🛡️ Security Hardening & Vibe-Coding Protections
- **Zero Plain-Text Credentials**: Client-side salted SHA-256 hashing for offline storage; scrypt password hashing for cloud API.
- **Hidden File & Source Code Protection**: Rules block `/.git`, `/.env`, and internal config endpoints with HTTP 403 Forbidden.
- **Anti-Account Takeover**: PIN resets require verified device ownership and a private secret recovery key.
- **Strict Schema Validation**: Validates all inputs against strict schemas rather than merely escaping.
- **Exponential Backoff**: Auth endpoints enforce progressive delays against brute-force attacks.
- **3D Spatial Worldwide Arena**: Olympic-style 3D podium and centralized global leaderboard powered by cloud database.
- **Universal Black Typography**: High-contrast, bold black text across all buttons, inputs, and gameplay controls.
- **Custom Character Wardrobe & Shop (v1.8)**: Added complete custom character purchasing engine where players can unlock 11 unique characters (Chaiwala, Sharma ji, Chef Bholu, Havaldar, Chai Ninja, Tea King, etc.) using their earned coins and equip them. Re-labeled Worldwide section to 'लाइव रैंक' (Live Rank).
- **Anime Sharingan-to-Rinnegan Boot Loader (v2.0)**: Smooth eye-evolution loading screen inspired by Naruto Uchiha sharingan & rinnegan.
- **Next-Gen Floating Glass Capsule Dock (v2.1)**: Added mobile-native floating bottom navigation dock inspired by 10 next-gen UI designs, providing 1-tap glassmorphic access to Home, Shop, Characters, Live Rank, and Settings with tactile sound effects.
- **Background Freeze & Timer Pause System (v2.2)**: Opening Settings or modal dialogs instantly freezes the background (`blur(10px) brightness(0.65)`), locks scrolling, pauses all background CSS animations (`animation-play-state: paused`), disables dock clicks, and pauses active gameplay timers until closed.
- **Smart Audio Lifecycle & Background Auto-Mute (v2.3)**: Audio and music automatically halt immediately when the screen turns off, when switching apps/tabs, on incoming phone calls (`blur`/`visibilitychange`), or when closing the game (`pagehide`/`beforeunload`), resuming gracefully only when returning to the game.
- **Interactive Top-Layer Floating Dock (v2.4)**: When Settings or any modal opens, the background page remains completely frozen and blurred, while the bottom glass capsule dock stays elevated on top (`z-index: 120`), perfectly sharp, and interactive, enabling seamless 1-tap switching between Home, Shop, Characters, Live Rank, and Settings.
- **Universal Unified Color Palette (v2.5)**: Enforced 100% identical styling, typography, and contrast across all mobile devices regardless of device OS dark/light mode preferences.
- **Persistent Global Capsule Dock**: The floating bottom capsule navigation dock remains elevated and active across all views and modals, allowing instantaneous 1-tap switching between Leaderboard, Home, Settings, Shop, and Characters.
- **Level Progression Guarantee & High-Speed Engine (v2.6)**: Guaranteed fail-safe progression on level wins (zero 'try again' blockers). Halved move/fly animation latency from 420ms down to 210ms with smooth cubic-bezier physics, ensuring instant responsive puzzle gameplay.
